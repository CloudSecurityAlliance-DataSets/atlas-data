MLCS0000:
  name: Microsoft Edge AI - Evasion
  summary: |
    The Azure Red Team performed a red team exercise on a new Microsoft product designed for running AI workloads at the Edge.

  procedure:
    - tactic: org.mitre.attack.enterprise.TA0043  # Reconnaissance
      technique: MLT0000  # Acquire OSINT Information
      description: |
        The team first performed reconnaissance to gather information about the target ML model.
    - tactic: org.mitre.attack.enterprise.TA0043  # Reconnaissance
      technique: MLT0001  # ML Model Discovery
      description: |
        The team identified and obtained the publically available base model.
    - tactic: org.mitre.attack.enterprise.TA0043  # Reconnaissance
      technique: MLT0004  # Gathering Datasets
      description: |
        The team obtained the datasets used by the model.
    - tactic: MLTA0000  # Model Evasion
      technique: MLT0017  # Offline Evasion
      description: |
        Then, used a publicly available version of the ML model, started sending queries and analyzing the responses (inferences) from the ML model.
        Using this, the red team created an automated system that continuously manipulated an original target image, that tricked the ML model into producing incorrect inferences, but the perturbations in the image were unnoticeable to the human eye.
    - tactic: MLTA0000  # Model Evasion
      technique: MLT0016  # Online Evasion
      description: |
        Feeding this perturbed image, the red team was able to evade the ML model into misclassifying the input image.
