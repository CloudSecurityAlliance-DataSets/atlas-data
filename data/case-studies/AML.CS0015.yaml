name: Kaspersky - DeepQuarantine Poisoning
object-type: case-study
incident-date: 2021-01-01
incident-date-granularity: YEAR
summary: 'Kaspersky''s ML team demonstrated a data poisoning attack on its own anti-spam
  system.

  The aim of the attack is to force the DeepQuarantine model, which is a deep learning
  model and part of the anti-spam system, to detain legitimate emails, thereby disrupting
  the business process of a particular company that is a user of Kaspersky''s anti-spam
  system.

  It is important to note that such an attack does not require access to the system.

  The adversaries only need to find out if the target company is using the anti-spam
  system. They can do this by sending an email to the targeted company and soliciting
  a response.

  The adversaries will receive the necessary information from the response email,
  since the RFC headers of the email will contain the email headers set by this anti-spam
  system.

  Once identified as a user of the anti-spam system, the attacker then sends malicious
  emails to the victim or another company that is a user of the same system.

  These messages should have email headers similar to the email headers provided by
  the Mail User Agent of the targeted company.

  Since these messages are malicious (for example, they contain phishing URLs or malicious
  files) the anti-spam system will block these messages and they would get into the
  training dataset with a spam label.

  After training on the poisoned dataset, the model will impede communications of
  the targeted company.

procedure:
- tactic: '{{reconnaissance.id}}'
  technique: '{{active_scanning.id}}'
  description: 'Adversaries perform targeting by soliciting an email response from
    the victim organization.


    The RFC headers in an email from an organization using Kaspersky''s anti-spam
    system are identifiable.

  technique: '{{victim_research_preprint.id}}'
  description: 'Adversaries can learn more about the DeepQuarantine model from the
    research paper published in a public pre-print repository [2].


    This provides adversaries with more detailed information about the architecture
    of the model and how it handles email as well as information about the way the
    training dataset is constructed.

    This access to the ML-enabled system can be used by adversaries to carry out the
    rest of their operation.

  description: 'After the model has been trained on the poisoned data and released
    to production, it starts to delay legitimate emails from the victim company.


    This leads to the disruption of the business processes of this company.
