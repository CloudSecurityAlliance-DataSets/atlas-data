- &ml_model_access
  id: AML.TA0000
  name: ML Model Access
  object-type: tactic
  description: |
    An adversary is attempting to gain some level of access to a machine learning model.

    ML Model Access consists of techniques that use various types of access to the machine learning model that can be used by the adversary to gain information, develop attacks, and as a means to input data to the model.
    The level of access can range from the full knowledge of the internals of the model to access to the physical environment where data is collected for use in the machine learning model.
    The adversary may use varying levels of model access during the course of their attack, from staging the attack to impacting the target system.

- &ml_attack_staging
  id: AML.TA0001
  name: ML Attack Staging
  object-type: tactic
  description: |
    An adversary is leveraging their knowledge of and access to the target system to tailor the attack.

    ML Attack Staging consists of techniques adversaries use to prepare their attack on the target ML model.
    Techniques can include training proxy models, poisoning the target model, and crafting adversarial data to feed the target model.
    Some of these techniques can be performed in an offline manor and are thus difficult to mitigate.
    These techniques are often used to achieve the adversary's end goal.

- &reconnaissance
  id: AML.TA0002
  name: Reconnaissance
  object-type: tactic
  description: |
    The adversary is trying to gather information they can use to plan
    future operations.

    Reconnaissance consists of techniques that involve adversaries actively or passively gathering information that can be used to support targeting.
    Such information may include details of the victim organization, infrastructure, or staff/personnel.
    This information can be leveraged by the adversary to aid in other phases of the adversary lifecycle, such as using gathered information to plan and execute Initial Access, to scope and prioritize post-compromise objectives, or to drive and lead further Reconnaissance efforts.

- &resource_development
  id: AML.TA0003
  name: Resource Development
  object-type: tactic
  description: |
    The adversary is trying to establish resources they can use to support operations.

    Resource Development consists of techniques that involve adversaries creating,
    purchasing, or compromising/stealing resources that can be used to support targeting.
    Such resources include infrastructure, accounts, or capabilities.
    These resources can be leveraged by the adversary to aid in other phases of the adversary lifecycle, such as using purchased domains to support Command and Control, email accounts for phishing as a part of Initial Access, or stealing code signing certificates to help with Defense Evasion.

- &initial_access
  id: AML.TA0004
  name: Initial Access
  object-type: tactic
  description: |
    The adversary is trying to get into your network.

    Initial Access consists of techniques that use various entry vectors to gain their initial foothold within a network.
    Techniques used to gain a foothold include targeted spearphishing and exploiting weaknesses on public-facing web servers.
    Footholds gained through initial access may allow for continued access, like valid accounts and use of external remote services, or may be limited-use due to changing passwords.

- &execution
  id: AML.TA0005
  name: Execution
  object-type: tactic
  description: |
    The adversary is trying to run malicious code.

    Execution consists of techniques that result in adversary-controlled code running on a local or remote system.
    Techniques that run malicious code are often paired with techniques from all other tactics to achieve broader goals, like exploring a network or stealing data. For example, an adversary might use a remote access tool to run a PowerShell script that does Remote System Discovery.

- &persistence
  id: AML.TA0006
  name: Persistence
  object-type: tactic
  description: |
    The adversary is trying to maintain their foothold.

    Persistence consists of techniques that adversaries use to keep access to systems across restarts, changed credentials, and other interruptions that could cut off their access. Techniques used for persistence include any access, action, or configuration changes that let them maintain their foothold on systems, such as replacing or hijacking legitimate code or adding startup code.

- &defense_evasion
  id: AML.TA0005
  name: Defense Evasion
  object-type: tactic
  description: |
    The adversary is trying to avoid being detected.

    Defense Evasion consists of techniques that adversaries use to avoid detection throughout their compromise.
    Techniques used for defense evasion include uninstalling/disabling security software or obfuscating/encrypting data and scripts.
    Adversaries also leverage and abuse trusted processes to hide and masquerade their malware.
    Other tactics & techniques are cross-listed here when those techniques include the added benefit of subverting defenses.

- &discovery
  id: AML.TA0007
  name: Discovery
  object-type: tactic
  description: |
    The adversary is trying to figure out your environment.

    Discovery consists of techniques an adversary may use to gain knowledge about the system and internal network.
    These techniques help adversaries observe the environment and orient themselves before deciding how to act.
    They also allow adversaries to explore what they can control and what's around their entry point in order to discover how it could benefit their current objective.
    Native operating system tools are often used toward this post-compromise information-gathering objective.

- &collection
  id: AML.TA0009
  name: Collection
  object-type: tactic
  description: |
    The adversary is trying to gather data of interest to their goal.

    Collection consists of techniques adversaries may use to gather information and
    the sources information is collected from that are relevant to following through
    on the adversary''s objectives. Frequently, the next goal after collecting data
    is to steal (exfiltrate) the data. Common target sources include various drive
    types, browsers, audio, video, and email. Common collection methods include capturing
    screenshots and keyboard input.

- &exfiltration
  id: AML.TA0010
  name: Exfiltration
  object-type: tactic
  description: |
    The adversary is trying to steal data.

    Exfiltration consists of techniques that adversaries may use to steal data from your network.
    Once they've collected data, adversaries often package it to avoid detection while removing it.
    This can include compression and encryption.
    Techniques for getting data out of a target network typically include transferring it over their command and control channel or an alternate channel and may also include putting size limits on the transmission.

- &impact
  id: AML.TA0040
  name: Impact
  object-type: tactic
  description: |
    The adversary is trying to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy your systems and data.

    Impact consists of techniques that adversaries use to disrupt availability or compromise integrity by manipulating business and operational processes. Techniques used for impact can include destroying or tampering with data.
    In some cases, business processes can look fine, but may have been altered to benefit the adversaries' goals. These techniques might be used by adversaries to follow through on their end goal or to provide cover for a confidentiality breach.
