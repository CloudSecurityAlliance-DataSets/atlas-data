  mapping_notes: |
    This is a core evasion technique that requires multi-layered defense.
    Prevention focuses on building robust models, detection on runtime monitoring,
    response on immediate mitigation, and recovery on model improvement.
    
    Key considerations:
    - Adversarial training is most effective prevention
    - Runtime detection requires careful threshold tuning
    - Recovery should include lessons learned integration
