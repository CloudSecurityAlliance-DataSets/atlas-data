  description: 'The adversary is trying to steal account names and passwords.


    Credential Access consists of techniques for stealing credentials like account
    names and passwords. Techniques used to get credentials include keylogging or
    credential dumping. Using legitimate credentials can give adversaries access to
    systems, make them harder to detect, and provide the opportunity to create more
    accounts to help achieve their goals.

    description: 'Adversaries may search compromised systems to find and obtain insecurely
      stored credentials.

      These credentials can be stored and/or misplaced in many locations on a system,
      including plaintext files (e.g. bash history), environment variables, operating
      system, or application-specific repositories (e.g. Credentials in Registry),
      or other specialized files/artifacts (e.g. private keys).
