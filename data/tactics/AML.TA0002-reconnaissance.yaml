  description: 'The adversary is trying to gather information about the AI system
    they can use to plan future operations.


    Reconnaissance consists of techniques that involve adversaries actively or passively
    gathering information that can be used to support targeting.

    Such information may include details of the victim organizations'' AI capabilities
    and research efforts.

    This information can be leveraged by the adversary to aid in other phases of the
    adversary lifecycle, such as using gathered information to obtain relevant AI
    artifacts, targeting AI capabilities used by the victim, tailoring attacks to
    the particular models used by the victim, or to drive and lead further Reconnaissance
    efforts.'

    description: 'Adversaries may search for publicly available research and technical
      documentation to learn how and where AI is used within a victim organization.

      The adversary can use this information to identify targets for attack, or to
      tailor an existing attack to make it more effective.

      Organizations often use open source model architectures trained on additional
      proprietary data in production.

      Knowledge of this underlying architecture allows the adversary to craft more
      realistic proxy models ([Create Proxy AI Model](/techniques/AML.T0005)).

      An adversary can search these resources for publications for authors employed
      at the victim organization.


      Research and technical materials may exist as academic papers published in [Journals
      and Conference Proceedings](/techniques/AML.T0000.000), or stored in [Pre-Print
      Repositories](/techniques/AML.T0000.001), as well as [Technical Blogs](/techniques/AML.T0000.002).'

    name: Search Open AI Vulnerability Analysis
    description: 'Much like the [Search Open Technical Databases](/techniques/AML.T0000),
      there is often ample research available on the vulnerabilities of common AI
      models. Once a target has been identified, an adversary will likely try to identify
      any pre-existing work that has been done for this class of models.

      This will include not only reading academic papers that may identify the particulars
      of a successful attack, but also identifying pre-existing implementations of
      those attacks. The adversary may obtain [Adversarial AI Attack Implementations](/techniques/AML.T0016.000)
      or develop their own [Adversarial AI Attacks](/techniques/AML.T0017.000) if
      necessary.'

    name: Search Victim-Owned Websites
    description: 'Adversaries may search websites owned by the victim for information
      that can be used during targeting.

      Victim-owned websites may contain technical details about their AI-enabled products
      or services.

      Victim-owned websites may contain a variety of details, including names of departments/divisions,
      physical locations, and data about key employees such as names, roles, and contact
      info.

      These sites may also have details highlighting business operations and relationships.


      Adversaries may search victim-owned websites to gather actionable information.

      This information may help adversaries tailor their attacks (e.g. [Adversarial
      AI Attacks](/techniques/AML.T0017.000) or [Manual Modification](/techniques/AML.T0043.003)).

      Information from these sources may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance
      (e.g. [Search Open Technical Databases](/techniques/AML.T0000) or [Search Open
      AI Vulnerability Analysis](/techniques/AML.T0001))'
