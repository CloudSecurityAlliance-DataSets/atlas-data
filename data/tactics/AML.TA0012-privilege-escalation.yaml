  description: 'The adversary is trying to gain higher-level permissions.


    Privilege Escalation consists of techniques that adversaries use to gain higher-level
    permissions on a system or network. Adversaries can often enter and explore a
    network with unprivileged access but require elevated permissions to follow through
    on their objectives. Common approaches are to take advantage of system weaknesses,
    misconfigurations, and vulnerabilities. Examples of elevated access include:

    - SYSTEM/root level

    - local administrator

    - user account with admin-like access

    - user accounts with access to specific system or perform specific function


    These techniques often overlap with Persistence techniques, as OS features that
    let an adversary persist can execute in an elevated context.

    name: LLM Plugin Compromise
    description: 'Adversaries may use their access to an LLM that is part of a larger
      system to compromise connected plugins.

      LLMs are often connected to other services or resources via plugins to increase
      their capabilities.

      Plugins may include integrations with other applications, access to public or
      private data sources, and the ability to execute code.


      This may allow adversaries to execute API calls to integrated applications or
      plugins, providing the adversary with increased privileges on the system.

      Adversaries may take advantage of connected data sources to retrieve sensitive
      information.

      They may also use an LLM integrated with a command or script interpreter to
      execute arbitrary instructions.

    name: LLM Jailbreak
    description: 'An adversary may use a carefully crafted [LLM Prompt Injection](/techniques/AML.T0051)
      designed to place LLM in a state in which it will freely respond to any user
      input, bypassing any controls, restrictions, or guardrails placed on the LLM.

      Once successfully jailbroken, the LLM can be used in unintended ways by the
      adversary.
